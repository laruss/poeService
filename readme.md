# poeService

## Overview

The `poeService` repository serves as a proxy for interacting with the API provided by `poe.com`. This setup is designed for easy integration within a Docker environment, facilitating direct access to `poe.com`'s API. The service leverages MongoDB for storing configurations such as API tokens. An example `docker-compose.yml` file is included in the repository to simplify deployment.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Getting Started

To use `poeService`, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/laruss/poeService.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd poeService
   ```

3. **Start the Service Using Docker Compose:**
   Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file to start the service along with MongoDB.
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will start the service and MongoDB in detached mode. The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:5002` by default.

### Configuring the API Token

After the service is up, set the API token for `poe.com` using the following API call:

- **Endpoint**: `PUT /settings`
- **Payload**: 
  ```json
  {
    "api_token": "<YOUR_POE_TOKEN>"
  }
  ```
- This token will be stored in MongoDB and used for subsequent API calls to `poe.com`.

### Usage

With `poeService` running, you can now interact with the `poe.com` API via the proxy. The service acts as a middleware, handling requests and responses to and from `poe.com`.
